Gradle
------
```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.bakkenbaeck:giphysearch:1.0'
}
```

Usage
-----

Implement GiphyListener.
```java
    class RecyclerAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<RecyclerAdapter.ViewHolder> implements GiphyListener {
        @Override
        public void onGifsLoaded(List<GiphyData> gifs) {
            // This is called when the gifs have loaded
        }
    }

```

Initialise GiphySearch by passing it your GiphyListener implementation.
```java
    private void initGiphySearch() {
        final RecyclerAdapter adapter = new RecyclerAdapter(this);
        final GiphySearch giphySearch = new GiphySearch(adapter);
        giphySearch.search("make it rain!");
    }
```

The sample contains a full implementation using RecyclerView.
